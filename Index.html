<center><h1>Toyota Believe: Our Values</h1></center>

<center><img src="img/tacoma.jpg" alt="tacoma"></center>
    <h2>We believe everyday's an opportunity to improve</h2>
	<p>We believe we can and will do great things. We are a company driven by 
	imagination, experimentation, humility, respect and innovation. And we believe
	it is people, our people, who will go the extra mile to deliver to our customers
	all that Toyota promises to be, today and into the future. It's about integrity.
    Our actions are guided by eight core beliefs which are the differentiating point
	for our customers, staff, in our products and in our services. These beliefs are 
	derived from two guiding Toyota principles of 'Continuous Improvement' and 'Respect
	for People' and reflect our core values and culture to our New Zealand customers.  </p>
	
	<h2>We believe a better tomorrow starts today</h2>
	<p>We believe that if you can dream it you can do it
       We will continue to set ourselves seemingly impossible goals 
	   and continue to strive to achieve them.

        For example, Prius came from a goal of trying to build a car that
		would set a new standard in energy use and reuse. Prius c is an 
		innovative smaller city car that doesn't compromise on interior 
		
		space or safety. Our latest goal is to build a car that makes
		the air cleaner as it drives. Of course this sounds impossible,
		but none the less, our engineers are aspiring to do just that. 
        Improve how they are built by making our factories more environmentally 
		friendly. We've begun to do this by introducing energy efficient paint 
		booths to the Thames Vehicle Operations centre. We are also exploring
		how we can convert our Thames refurbishment processes to use water-borne
		paints.		</p>
